## ðŸ”’ Production Security Requirements

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change all default passwords and secrets
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all external endpoints
- [ ] Configure CORS properly for production domains
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure backup strategy

### Environment Variables for Production
```bash
# Generate secure JWT secret
openssl rand -hex 32

# Use production database URLs with SSL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require

# Use HTTPS for OAuth redirects
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All secrets managed via secure secret management system
- [ ] Database backups configured
- [ ] Container security scanning enabled
- [ ] Network security (VPC, security groups) configured
- [ ] SSL certificates properly configured
- [ ] Health checks and monitoring setup
